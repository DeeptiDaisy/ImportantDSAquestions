# Interview Questions and Answers - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This README contains a compilation of frequently asked interview questions related to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with their answers. Use this resource to prepare for your web development interviews and boost your confidence.

## HTML Interview Questions

1. **What is the purpose of DOCTYPE in HTML?**
   - The DOCTYPE declaration specifies the type of HTML version used in the document. It helps browsers render the page correctly by following the appropriate specifications.

2. **What are the semantic elements in HTML5?**
   - Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc., provide meaning to the structure of a web page, making it more accessible and SEO-friendly.

3. **What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>` in HTML?**
   - `<div>` is a block-level element, and `<span>` is an inline element. `<div>` is used for grouping elements, while `<span>` is often used to apply styles to a specific part of text.

4. **What is the `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag used for?**
   - The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for an image. It is displayed if the image fails to load or for accessibility purposes to assist users with screen readers.

5. **How can you embed an audio file in HTML?**
   - You can use the `<audio>` element to embed audio files. Example: `<audio src="audiofile.mp3" controls></audio>`

## CSS Interview Questions

1. **Explain the box model in CSS.**
   - The box model describes the layout of elements in CSS, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin. It determines the total space occupied by an element.

2. **What is the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`?**
   - `display: block;` creates a block-level element that takes up the full width available, while `display: inline;` creates an inline element with only as much width as necessary.

3. **What is CSS specificity?**
   - CSS specificity is a set of rules that determines which CSS styles are applied when there are conflicting styles targeting the same element. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes, and element selectors.

4. **What is the purpose of CSS vendor prefixes?**
   - Vendor prefixes (e.g., `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, `-ms-`, `-o-`) are used to apply experimental or browser-specific CSS properties until they are fully supported by all browsers.

5. **Explain the CSS `box-sizing` property.**
   - The `box-sizing` property defines how the width and height of an element are calculated. Setting it to `border-box` includes padding and border in the specified width, making it more intuitive for layout.

## JavaScript Interview Questions

1. **Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.**
   - Closures are functions that remember the variables from the outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. They help in creating private variables and maintaining state in functional programming.

2. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**
   - `==` is used for loose equality comparison, allowing type coercion, while `===` is used for strict equality comparison, ensuring both value and type match.
   - JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables

3. **What is event delegation in JavaScript?**
   - Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to handle events on its child elements. It improves performance and avoids attaching multiple listeners.

4. **Explain the usage of `let`, `const`, and `var` in variable declaration.**
   - `let` and `const` are block-scoped variables introduced in ES6. `let` allows reassignment, while `const` declares constants that can't be reassigned. `var` is function-scoped and pre-ES6.
    Certainly! Here's a table comparing the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript:

| Feature                 | var                                          | let                                       | const                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Scope                   | Function-scoped (accessible within a function) | Block-scoped (accessible within a block)  | Block-scoped (accessible within a block)  |
| Hoisting                | Hoisted to the top of the function          | Hoisted to the top of the block          | Hoisted to the top of the block          |
| Re-declaration          | Allows re-declaration within the same scope  | Does not allow re-declaration in the same block  | Does not allow re-declaration in the same block  |
| Value Assignment        | Can be assigned and reassigned               | Can be assigned and reassigned               | Must be assigned a value during declaration, and cannot be reassigned |
| Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)| Not affected by Temporal Dead Zone          | Affected by Temporal Dead Zone            | Affected by Temporal Dead Zone            |
| Global Object Property  | Creates a property on the global object (window in browsers) | Does not create a property on the global object | Does not create a property on the global object |
| Constant                | Not a constant; value can be changed         | Not a constant; value can be changed         | Constant; value cannot be changed          |

In summary, `var` is function-scoped and hoisted to the top of the function, `let` and `const` are block-scoped and hoisted to the top of the block. Both `let` and `const` enforce the Temporal Dead Zone, preventing access to variables before their declaration within a block. `var` allows re-declaration within the same scope, while `let` and `const` do not. `const` requires a value to be assigned during declaration and cannot be reassigned once set, making it a true constant.

5. **What is the purpose of `async` and `await` in JavaScript?**
   - `async` and `await` are used to handle asynchronous operations in a more synchronous-looking way, simplifying the code and making it easier to read and maintain.
